Copilot Instructions — VirtualCandy
Project purpose

VirtualCandy.com is a hybrid content + affiliate shop with an interactive “Candyverse” modal (planets → constellations → products). The site is static-first and progressively enhanced; affiliate links open on partner sites.

Tech & style

Framework: Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind

Style: clean, accessible, minimal motion; modern cards, rounded-2xl, subtle shadows

Formatting: Prettier; ESLint for JS/TS; Tailwind class order flexible but readable

Node: 18+; package manager: pnpm

Non-goals

No backend monolith; avoid server-heavy SSR unless strictly needed

No complex state libs (Redux/MobX); prefer React state + pure helpers

No secret keys or affiliate IDs hardcoded in code or data files

File boundaries & invariants

Single source of truth for product data: CANDYVERSE_DATA
(plan to migrate to /data/candyverse.json later)

Helpers must be pure and defined once:

getFeaturedFrom(data) → Product[] (≤ 8)

getFeaturedProducts() → Product[] (from CANDYVERSE_DATA)

aggregatePlanetProducts(planetId) → flattened Product[]

Do NOT re-declare: CANDYVERSE_DATA, getFeaturedProducts, Product type

Keep types co-located with helpers or in a shared types.ts only if helpful

URL & UX contracts

Deep links use hash only:
#candyverse?planet=<id>&view=all or &constellation=<id>

Dev panel is opt-in: ?dev=1

Hotkeys are opt-in: ?keys=1

G → Gummies (View All)

C → Chocolate (last tab)

R → Retro (last tab)

S → Sour (last tab)

Modal keeps URL hash in sync and resets to #candyverse on close

“Copy link” must preserve query params (?dev=1, ?keys=1, etc.)

Accessibility & performance

Keyboard: never hijack keys in inputs/contentEditable; ignore when alt/meta/ctrl held

Buttons/links have visible focus; add ARIA where relevant

Lazy-load heavy assets; keep images/video/CDN outside repo (or use LFS)

Avoid re-render loops; use useMemo/useEffect dependency arrays correctly

Testing & DevTests

Keep the in-browser DevTests panel active under ?dev=1:

no duplicate planet IDs

constellations expose products[]

products contain id/name/url minimally

getFeaturedProducts() returns ≤ 8

aggregate “View All” equals per-constellation sum

deep-link parser basics pass

If adding helpers, add a new DevTest item instead of changing existing ones

Data model rules

Planets have unique id, ≥ 1 constellation

Constellations have unique id (per planet) and products[]

Product: { id, name, vendor, price, url, image, note? }

Never mutate CANDYVERSE_DATA in helpers

Allowed libraries & patterns

React + Next.js; Tailwind for styles; no CSS-in-JS

Optional: Framer Motion (light), Three.js later for Candyverse scene

Prefer small, local utilities over adding dependencies

Security & affiliate policy

No secrets in code. Affiliate tags via env vars (e.g., AFFIL_AMAZON_TAG)

Disclose affiliate relationships in UI copy (already present)

Commit/PR conventions

Branches: feat/*, fix/*, refactor/*, chore/*, docs/*

PRs explain the “why,” include screenshots for UI, and list any changed invariants

Don’t merge if any DevTests regress

Things to avoid (important)

Duplicating constants/helpers/types

Introducing SSR for pages that can be static

Global key listeners without opt-in guards

Heavy dependencies for trivial tasks

Writing to global/window state except URL hash sync

Examples Copilot should follow

When adding a tab, compute badge counts from data (don’t hardcode)

When adding a helper, write it pure and add a DevTest

When changing modal behavior, keep deep-link + copy-link contracts
